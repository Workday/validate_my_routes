# Simple example with multiple routes

This is an example of `validate_my_routes` usage with sharing parameter validation between
multiple routes.

To test it simply install dependencies:

```bash
bundle install
```

And start the webserver:

```bash
bundle exec ruby app.rb
```

After you can test your application by sending http requests to `http://localhost:8080/`.

There are some examples of http requests in `tests.http` file.
